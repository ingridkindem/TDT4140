#Internal guidelines for gitlab 

1. All communication on gitblab should be in English. E. g. commit messages, comments on issues, this readme and so on. If you are in doubt - go English.

2. Every issue related to the project should be solved in a branch named "NameOfISsue"+"#"+"issue number". Notice the camel case in issue name. E. g. your issue is login controller, and your issue number is 23. Your branch name should the be LoginController#23.

3. !!The master branch is sacred and is not to be trifled with!! 

4. We will have two main branches; master and develop. When branching out for your issues, make sure your current branch is develop. Before branching use "git pull" in terminal or pull directly in eclipse, to make sure you have the must updated version of our project.

5. When commiting to your branch, make sure your commit message is descriptive enough for the other group members to understand what you have done, and to some extent how you have done it.

6. When you have completed your commits and feel ready to close the issue. Create a pull request to develop branch. 

7. Each group member is responsible for updating their own issues. When you start working on your issue, move it from to-do to doing. Leave a comment and close the issue when you finish.



8. Avoid acronyms and initialism. Even though your shortening might seem obivious to you, that is not necessarliy the case for the rest of the group.
